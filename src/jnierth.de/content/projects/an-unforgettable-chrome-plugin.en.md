RMIT (University in Melbourne) created a new font which helps people to memorize content better. The font can be downloaded from this website for Windows or Mac to be used in Word documents or it can be used on websites through using a Chrome Plugin.

Scientists do not recommend the font to be used on whole pages therefore the plugin was created to work only on
 highlighted text on short paragraphs. Instructions on how to use the plugin can be found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sans-forgetica-study-mode/jojbobbpjflbaekncckdbanjoakgpbbc?hl=en).
